#This script simulates the work of server admins or infosec staff over the course of a year
#We retrieve two CSVs from the admin staff. It uses random data, precomputed to amke the demo go faster
#While this is simulated data, it is similar to what we have seen in real audits and consulting engagements

"This may take a minute..."

#PatchAge.csv has the "patch age" (number of days since the server was last patched) for
